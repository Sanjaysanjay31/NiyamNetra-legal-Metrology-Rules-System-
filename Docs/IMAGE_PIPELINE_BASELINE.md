### Architectural Key Points:
1. **Frontend:** React Native / Expo with `expo-camera` and `expo-image-manipulator`.
2. **Backend:** FastAPI with `SQLAlchemy` (PostgreSQL / SQLite fallback), OpenCV (`cv2`), and PaddleOCR.
3. **Storage:** Local filesystem (`data/images/<scan_id>/<uuid>.<ext>`) with metadata registered in the `images` SQL table. Secondary asynchronous mirroring to Supabase Storage via `BackgroundTasks`.

## Section B: Measured Timings (Real Measured Values)

### 1. Backend Image Upload Breakdown (`POST /scans/{scan_id}/images`)
*Measured on a standard 1600 × 1200 JPEG image (58,112 bytes):*

| Operation Stage | Time (ms) | % of Backend Time |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Multipart byte read (`t_raw - t_arrival`) | 0.05 ms | < 0.1% |
| MIME sniffing & header validation | 0.09 ms | < 0.1% |
| Probe decode (`imdecode` validation) | 2.12 ms | 0.9% |
| Disk write & SHA-256 computation (`store_image_bytes`) | 8.57 ms | 3.8% |
| Full BGR decode (`cv2.imdecode`) | 5.06 ms | 2.3% |
| Quality assessment (`assess_quality`: blur, glare, luma) | 27.75 ms | 12.5% |
| **pHash computation (`phash_bands` 64-bit DCT)** | **148.82 ms** | **66.8%** |
| Database commit & sequence conflict handling | 7.12 ms | 3.2% |
| Advisory panel quad detection (`detect_panel_quad`) | 18.77 ms | 8.4% |
| Background Supabase mirror dispatch | 0.10 ms | < 0.1% |
| **Total Backend Execution Time** | **222.62 ms** | **100.0%** |
| **Client HTTP Roundtrip Latency** | **237.69 ms** | - |

> **Key Observation:** The 64-bit DCT perceptual hash computation (`phash_bands`) consumes **148.82 ms** (**66.8%** of the entire image upload request), dominating the upload path.

---

### 2. Backend Statutory Assessment Breakdown (`POST /scans/{scan_id}/assess`)
*Measured on a single-panel package scan:*

| Operation Stage | Time (ms) | % of Assessment Time |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Request routing & auth validation | 0.12 ms | < 0.1% |
| Image loading from disk (`cv2.imread`) | 19.33 ms | 0.16% |
| Front panel quality gate evaluation | 28.10 ms | 0.24% |
| Panel quad detection (`detect_panel_quad`) | 23.04 ms | 0.20% |
| Perspective rectification / homography warp (`rectify`) | 28.27 ms | 0.24% |
| **OCR Text Extraction (`PaddleOCR` multi-stage cascade)** | **11,569.37 ms** | **98.47%** |
| Statutory Rule Evaluation (`rules_engine.assess` - 19 rules) | 2.78 ms | 0.02% |
| Findings persistence & Scan DB commit | 75.45 ms | 0.64% |
| Audit trail append & response serialization | 2.21 ms | 0.02% |
| **Total Backend Execution Time** | **11,748.67 ms** | **100.0%** |
| **Client HTTP Roundtrip Latency** | **11,774.55 ms** | - |

> **Key Observation:** OCR text extraction accounts for **98.5%** of the assessment latency (~11.57 seconds). In contrast, the 19 statutory rules execute in an ultra-fast **2.78 ms**.

### 3. Inspector-Visible Wait Time (End-to-End Mobile Flow)

| Step | Time Range (ms) | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **A. Camera capture** | 450 – 650 ms | `cameraRef.current.takePictureAsync({ quality: 0.8 })` |
| **B. Client compression** | 180 – 320 ms | `ImageManipulator.manipulateAsync` (1600px, 75% quality) |
| **C. Capture-to-Local-Ready** | **630 – 970 ms** | Inspector can inspect panel thumbnail on screen |
| **D. Inspection creation** | 120 – 250 ms | `POST /inspections/` |
| **E. Scan creation** | 110 – 220 ms | `POST /inspections/{id}/scans` |

| **H. Authoritative assessment** | 11,750 – 13,500 ms | `POST /scans/{id}/assess` |
| **Total Wait (1 Panel)** | **12.5 – 14.5 seconds** | Full wait from clicking "Assess" to modal |
| **Total Wait (4 Panels)** | **13.5 – 16.0 seconds** | Full wait from clicking "Assess" to modal |

## Section C: Current Thresholds & Gating Parameters

All thresholds documented below are active in `Backend/image_processor.py`, `Backend/storage.py`, and `Frontend_App/screens/inspector/InspectionSessionScreen.jsx`:

| Parameter | Current Value | Component | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `BLUR_FLOOR` | `60.0` | `image_processor.py` | Laplacian variance threshold. Below 60.0 fails with `"Image too blurry"`. |
| `GLARE_CEILING` | `0.15` | `image_processor.py` | Max fraction of pixels with brightness >= 250. Above 0.15 fails with `"Excessive glare"`. |
| `LUMA_FLOOR` | `40.0` | `image_processor.py` | Mean grayscale brightness floor. Below 40.0 fails with `"Lighting too dark"`. |
| `LUMA_CEILING` | `235.0` | `image_processor.py` | Mean grayscale brightness ceiling. Above 235.0 fails with `"Image overexposed"`. |
| `PHASH_HAMMING_THRESHOLD` | `10` | `image_processor.py` | Maximum bit distance (out of 64) to classify an image as a duplicate. |
| `PHASH_BANDS` | `4 × 16-bit` | `image_processor.py` | 4 hex bands for indexed lookup in the `images` table. |
| Client Resize Width | `1600 px` | `InspectionSessionScreen.jsx` | Downsamples raw camera photo width to 1600px. |
| Client Compression Quality | `0.75` (75%) | `InspectionSessionScreen.jsx` | JPEG compression quality passed to `ImageManipulator`. |
| Camera Capture Quality | `0.80` (80%) | `InspectionSessionScreen.jsx` | Quality setting in `takePictureAsync`. |
| Maximum Image Dimensions | `100,000,000 px` | `storage.py` | Safety limit preventing decompression bomb attacks. |
| Maximum Upload File Size | `25 MB` (`26,214,400 B`) | `storage.py` | Maximum raw multipart payload accepted. |
| Default Fallback Dimensions | `120.0 × 80.0 mm` | `InspectionSessionScreen.jsx` | Hardcoded declared dimension scale sent by client. |

## Section D: Process Memory Baseline & Render 512MB RAM Risk

Memory was measured using OS-level process counters (`psapi.GetProcessMemoryInfo` WorkingSet on Windows, `/proc/self/status` VmRSS on Linux):

| Stage | Working Set / RSS | Delta |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Base Uvicorn worker (idle) | 116.4 MB | Baseline |
| During 1600×1200 decode & OpenCV quality check | 129.3 MB | +12.9 MB |
| Following image processing completion | 129.5 MB | +0.2 MB (retained in heap) |
| PaddleOCR model loading (det + rec + cls weights) | 320.0 – 350.0 MB | +190 – 220 MB |
| Active OCR inference on 1600×1200 image | **385.2 MB** | Peak memory during assessment |

### The Render 512MB RAM Risk:
1. **Headroom:** On Render.com Free / Starter tiers, the RAM ceiling is **512 MB**. A single Uvicorn worker running PaddleOCR reaches **~385 MB** (75.2% of total container memory).
2. **Concurrency Danger:** If **two** concurrent requests hit OCR or image decode simultaneously, memory consumption exceeds 512 MB. The Linux kernel OOM (Out-of-Memory) killer immediately sends `SIGKILL (exit code 137)`, restarting the container and dropping all active inspector requests.
3. **Conclusion:** Backend image processing must strictly avoid loading redundant full-size image copies in memory, and OCR concurrency must be tightly throttled or offloaded.

---

## Section E: Current Upload Behavior

1. **Sequential vs. Parallel:** In `InspectionSessionScreen.jsx`, panels are uploaded via `Promise.all(uploadTasks)`, transmitting panel images concurrently.
2. **Synchronous Awaiting:** The mobile app waits for all panel uploads to resolve before requesting `/scans/{scan_id}/assess`.
3. **No Retries on Upload Failure:** If any panel fails to upload, the entire assessment flow errors out or aborts to offline fallback.
4. **Backend Sequence Conflict Mitigation:** The backend implements a 3-attempt loop querying `MAX(sequence) + 1` to prevent unique constraint conflicts on `(scan_id, panel, sequence)`.

---

## Section F: Current Evidence Behavior (Provenance Audit)

| Provenance Requirement | Current Status | Finding |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Original Raw Bytes Preserved?** | **NO** | `InspectionSessionScreen.jsx` replaces the raw camera URI with the output of `ImageManipulator.manipulateAsync` (1600px, 75% JPEG). The raw capture is unlinked and permanently lost. |
| **Camera Image Overwritten?** | **YES** | Local state `panelPhotos` references only the downsampled file. |
| **When is SHA-256 Generated?** | **On Backend Only** | Generated inside `store_image_bytes` upon receiving the multipart stream. Client does not hash or sign original bytes. |
| **Supabase Mirroring Timing** | **Post-Commit Background** | Queued via FastAPI `BackgroundTasks.add_task(mirror_to_supabase)` after local disk write and DB insertion. |
| **Durable Local Copy on Device?** | **NO** | Files reside only in temporary Expo cache directories (`FileSystem.cacheDirectory`), which are subject to eviction by the OS under storage pressure. |

---

## Section G: Current Offline Behavior

1. **Queue Infrastructure:** An offline SQLite/AsyncStorage queue exists (`Frontend_App/services/queue.js` and `SyncProvider.js`) with support for background sync.
2. **Inspection Session Screen Reality:** `InspectionSessionScreen.jsx` **bypasses the offline queue** during active inspection. It makes direct, online HTTP calls to `/inspections/`, `/scans`, `/images`, and `/assess`.
3. **Offline Fallback Behavior:** If the network is unreachable, `InspectionSessionScreen` catches the network error and creates a simulated heuristic scan object locally (`createSimulatedScanItem`). However, **raw panel photos are NOT enqueued for durable background synchronization** to the backend.

## Section I: Top 5 Bottlenecks (Ranked by Measured Impact)

1. **OCR Text Extraction Latency (11,569 ms — 98.5% of assessment time)**
   - Synchronous CPU-bound PaddleOCR execution running on the main FastAPI event loop blocks worker threads and freezes mobile inspectors for over 11 seconds.
2. **Synchronous Mobile Inspection Waterfall (12.5 – 15.0 s Total Inspector Wait)**
   - Sequential execution of `createInspection` &rarr; `createScan` &rarr; `uploadScanImage` &rarr; `assessScan` while presenting a blocking modal spinner to the field inspector.
3. **Backend pHash Calculation Overhead (148.8 ms — 66.8% of image upload time)**
   - Calculating 64-bit DCT perceptual hashes on disk files for every panel dominates upload request latency.
4. **Destruction of Raw Forensic Evidence on Device**
   - Premature client-side compression to 1600px 75% JPEG irreversibly discards original raw camera bytes, camera EXIF tags, and fine text resolution essential for statutory evidence.
5. **Memory Bloat Approaching Render 512MB RAM Limit (~385 MB peak)**
   - Single-worker OCR pushes container RAM to 75% of capacity; concurrent requests cause catastrophic out-of-memory container termination.

---

## Section J: Known Risks

1. **Evidence Inadmissibility:** Because original raw camera bytes and EXIF signatures are deleted during client downsampling, evidence packages risk being challenged in judicial metrology proceedings.
2. **Mobile Network Timeout on Slow Connections:** Axios client timeout on mobile can trigger before the ~12-second assessment finishes on 3G/4G connections.
3. **Container Crash via OOM:** Multiple field officers scanning products concurrently on Render.com will trigger container termination.
4. **Offline Data Loss:** Captures taken during intermittent network connectivity fail to register in a durable persistent upload queue.

## Section M: Future Change Plan (Strictly Planned — Not Yet Implemented)

> **Notice:** The items below represent the roadmap for subsequent commits. None of these changes have been implemented in Commit 1.

1. **Commit 2:** Evidence preservation (store untouched original camera bytes, generate client-side SHA-256, decouple display thumbnails from forensic evidence).
2. **Commit 3:** Mobile background upload & async assessment queue (non-blocking inspector flow, optimistic UI, durable offline SQLite image queue).
3. **Commit 4:** Fast pre-check quality gating (instant blur/glare feedback on device before uploading full payload).
4. **Commit 5:** Image processing & memory optimization (streamlined pHash calculation, bounded array buffers to stay well within Render 512MB RAM).
