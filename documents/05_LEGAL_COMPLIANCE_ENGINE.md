## 1. Compliance Architecture & Statutory Safety Principles

The NiyamNetra Legal Compliance Engine is a strictly deterministic, versioned, date-aware expert system. It guarantees mathematical reproducibility and auditability for every evaluated pre-packaged commodity.

### 1.1 Non-Negotiable Statutory Safeguards
1. **Zero LLM Legal Rulings:** The LLM structures evidence text into typed JSON; deterministic code evaluates compliance. No language model output can ever declare a statutory violation.
2. **Anti-False-Violation Principle (Fail-Open on Uncertainty):** Missing photographic evidence or optical ambiguity must produce `not_assessed`, never `fail`. A trader cannot be flagged for a violation because a back panel was not photographed.
3. **Anti-False-Compliance Principle (Zero Fabricated Passes):** A package is never marked `compliant` if any mandatory panel or declaration remains unassessed. The denominator is always transparently recorded (e.g. `14 of 18 checks assessed`).
4. **Physical Scale Mandate:** Numeral and letter height checks under Rule 7 Table-I strictly require an optical calibration standard (ID-1 card or 5 INR coin). If uncalibrated, the check produces `not_assessed` with a calibration capture task.

## 2. Rule-Pack Versioning & Effective-Date Resolution

The legal engine loads versioned rule packs dynamically based on the inspection's statutory effective date (`rules_as_at`):

```python
# Date-aware statutory resolution in Backend/rules/loader.py
FOURTH_AMENDMENT_EFFECTIVE_DATE = date(2026, 9, 21)

if as_at_date >= FOURTH_AMENDMENT_EFFECTIVE_DATE:
    path = "lmpc_2026_09_v1.json"  # 26 Rules: Fourth Amendment baseline
else:
    path = "lmpc_2026_v1.json"     # 24 Rules: Pre-Fourth Amendment historical baseline
```

### Statutory Historical Baselines:
- **Fourth Amendment Baseline (`2026-09-21` onwards):** Incorporates G.S.R. 826(E). Inserts Rule 6(4A)(d) origin-marking requirements for soaps, shampoos, toothpastes, cosmetics, and toiletries. Omits former Rule 6(8).
- **Substituted Table-I Baseline (`2018-01-01` onwards):** Incorporates G.S.R. 629(E). All packages evaluate numeral height against **Table-I** (Table-II was permanently omitted).
- **Jan Vishwas Enforcement Tiers (`2026-05-01` onwards):** Incorporates Act 8 of 2026. Recommends advisory rectification notices for first-time technical labeling infractions prior to formal compounding.

## 3. Statutory Finding & Assessment State Machines

### 3.1 Per-Check Finding States (`FindingResult`)

Every individual check resolves to exactly one of three states:

| Finding State | Statutory Meaning | Trigger Condition |
|---|---|---|
| `pass` | Statutory Requirement Satisfied | Declaration observed, legally formatted, supported by verified provenance, within calibrated thresholds. |
| `fail` | Confirmed Statutory Breach | Mandatory declaration absent despite complete panel coverage, deceptive stickers, or below-minimum font height. |
| `not_assessed` | Inability to Verify | Incomplete panel coverage, optical blur/glare, missing calibration standard, or ambiguous statutory text. |

### 3.2 Package-Level Scan Assessment States (`ScanVerdict`)

Individual check findings aggregate into one of four overall package results:

```
┌─────────────────┬────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Scan Result     │ Aggregation Condition                                     │
├─────────────────┼────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ COMPLIANT       │ ALL applicable checks returned PASS. Zero NOT_ASSESSED.   │
│ VIOLATION       │ At least ONE applicable check returned FAIL.               │
│ REVIEW_REQUIRED │ ZERO failures, but one or more checks are NOT_ASSESSED,    │
│                 │ or cross-panel statutory conflict detected.                │
│ OUT_OF_SCOPE    │ Package is statutorily exempt (e.g. weight <= 10g).        │
└─────────────────┴────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## 4. Rule Categories & Evaluation Logic

### 4.1 Mandatory Declaration Rules (Rule 6(1))
- **`CHK01`:** Verifies presence of all core declarations: Manufacturer/Packer/Importer identity, Commodity Generic Name, Net Quantity, MRP, Month & Year of packing, and Consumer Care details.
- **`CHK04`:** Date format validation. Verifies Month and Year format (`MM/YYYY` or Month name and year). Flags expired shelf-life where expiry is declared.
- **`CHK11`:** Address completeness. Verifies that manufacturer address contains identifiable city and PIN code.
- **`CHK19`:** Consumer care validation. Checks for valid customer care email, postal address, and telephone number under Rule 6(1)(g).

### 4.2 Typography & Minimum Font Height (Rule 7 Table-I)
Rule 7 Table-I mandates minimum font height based on Principal Display Panel (PDP) area:

$$\text{PDP Area } (A) \longrightarrow \text{Minimum Height } (H_{\text{min}})$$

| PDP Area ($A$ in $\text{cm}^2$) | Normal Packaging ($H_{\text{min}}$ in mm) | Blown / Moulded / Perforated ($H_{\text{min}}$ in mm) |
|---|---|---|
| $A \leq 50$ | 1.0 mm | 1.5 mm |
| $50 < A \leq 100$ | 1.5 mm | 3.0 mm |
| $100 < A \leq 500$ | 2.5 mm | 4.0 mm |
| $500 < A \leq 2500$ | 4.0 mm | 6.0 mm |
| $A > 2500$ | 6.0 mm | 6.0 mm |

- **`CHK06`:** Verifies numeral height for Net Quantity and MRP declarations against Table-I thresholds.
- **`CHK07`:** Verifies letter height for accompanying units (e.g. "g", "ml", "kg") is not less than twice the numeral height where applicable.

### 4.3 Standard Packaging Sizes (Rule 5 read with Second Schedule)
- **`CHK10`:** Verifies standard commodity packaging sizes for prescribed goods (e.g., biscuits, baby foods, edible oils). Where packaging deviates from standard Second Schedule quantities, verifies that Unit Sale Price (USP) is prominently declared under Rule 6(1)(f).

### 4.4 Multi-Panel Consistency & Anti-Evasion Rules
- **`CHK12` (Unit Sale Price):** Verifies that retail packages carrying declared MRP also display Unit Sale Price in standard statutory units (Rs. per g/kg/ml/L).
- **`CHK13` (Sticker Regulations):** Flags unauthorized price stickers under Rule 6(1)(da). A sticker is permissible only if it reduces price for consumer benefit; obscuring original markings is a violation.
- **`CHK14` (Dual Pricing):** Prohibits declaring multiple MRPs on identical packages under Rule 6(2A).

### 4.5 Fourth Amendment Origin Marking (Rule 6(4A)(d))
- **`CHK23` (Cosmetics & Personal Care Origin):** Added under G.S.R. 826(E) effective 21.09.2026 for soaps, shampoos, toothpastes, cosmetics, and toiletries.
- **Statutory Review Boundary:** The introductory phrasing of parent Rule 6(4A) is permissive. To prevent false prosecutions under Section 36(1), the engine treats omitted symbols on these commodities as **`REVIEW_REQUIRED` (Manual Officer Review)** rather than an automated violation.
