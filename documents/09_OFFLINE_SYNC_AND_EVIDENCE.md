## 1. Offline Architectural Guarantees

In statutory field operations, enforcement officers frequently inspect storage premises, manufacturing basements, and remote markets with intermittent or non-existent cellular coverage. NiyamNetra guarantees:

1. **Local-First Persistence:** Evidence capture and inspector data entry never block on network availability. Every record is committed locally before transmission is attempted.
2. **Authoritative Original Immutability:** Original camera files stored locally are preserved bit-for-bit. Synchronization never compresses, re-encodes, or mutates the source evidence.
3. **Exactly-Once Semantics:** Network dropouts during uploads or flushes never produce duplicate inspections, double scans, or corrupted findings.
4. **Transparent Offline Provenance:** Every record created offline carries an immutable flag (`edited_offline = true`) and records the client-to-server time delta (`clock_skew_seconds`).

## 2. Structured Offline Queue State Machine

The client offline engine (`Frontend_App/offline/`) manages task lifecycles through a deterministic state machine:

### Queue Entry Schema (Local SQLite):
- `queue_id`: Unique client-generated UUIDv4.
- `action_type`: `CREATE_INSPECTION`, `CREATE_SCAN`, `UPLOAD_IMAGE`, `SUBMIT_INSPECTION`, `ADJUDICATE`.
- `payload`: JSON-serialized API request body.
- `evidence_uri`: Local filesystem path to original photo (`file:///...`).
- `idempotency_key`: Stable cryptographic string reused across retries.
- `attempts`: Retry counter (default 0).
- `created_at`: Monotonic local timestamp.
- `status`: `QUEUED_OFFLINE`, `UPLOADING`, `SYNCED`, `RETRY_SCHEDULED`, `SYNC_FAILED`.

## 3. Idempotency & Duplicate Prevention Contract

During flaky cellular handover, an HTTP POST request may reach the backend and commit to PostgreSQL, but the subsequent HTTP response may drop before reaching the mobile client. Without strict idempotency, an automated client retry would create a duplicate scan row.

### 3.1 Idempotency Key Handling (`routers/scans.py`, `routers/inspections.py`)
1. **Client Header:** Client sends `Idempotency-Key: <uuid>`.
2. **Server Verification:**
   - The server queries `idempotency_keys` table for `key = <uuid>`.
   - **Case A (Fresh Key):** The server processes the request, commits to PostgreSQL, writes the response status code and JSON payload into `idempotency_keys`, and returns the response.
   - **Case B (Replayed Key):** The server intercepts the duplicate request before database writes, reads the cached status code and payload from `idempotency_keys`, and returns the cached response immediately (`200 OK` / `201 Created`).
3. **TTL Expiration:** Cached idempotency keys are retained for 24 hours.

### 3.2 Idempotent Image Re-upload
If a client re-transmits an image upload that was already ingested:
- The server computes the SHA-256 digest of the incoming bytes.
- It queries `scan_images` for `scan_id == current_scan.id AND sha256 == incoming_sha`.
- If an exact match exists, the server returns the existing `image_id` with `status: 200 OK` and `"replayed": true`, preventing duplicate rows in the immutable evidence ledger.

## 4. Clock Skew Tracking & Temporal Integrity

An adversary could attempt to back-date or forward-date inspections by altering their mobile device clock. NiyamNetra protects temporal integrity through dual timestamps:

1. **Client Timestamp:** Recorded from device system clock at moment of capture (`local_created_at`).
2. **Server Arrival Timestamp:** Recorded from authoritative NTP-synchronized server clock (`created_at`).
3. **Clock Skew Calculation:**
   $$\text{clock\_skew\_seconds} = |\text{Server Time} - \text{Client Time}|$$
4. **Auditing Boundary:**
   - If $|\text{clock\_skew\_seconds}| > 300\text{ seconds}$ (5 minutes), the inspection record is flagged in the supervisory review queue as `OFFLINE_TIME_ANOMALY`.
   - The skew is recorded in `inspections.clock_skew_seconds` and printed in the formal inspection report.

## 5. Offline Smart Recapture & Reassessment Workflow

When an inspector completes an inspection offline that produces `REVIEW_REQUIRED`:

1. **Offline Task Generation:** The local client engine analyzes assessment findings and surfaces pending capture tasks (e.g. `CAP_BACK_PANEL_MISSING`).
2. **Offline Task Fulfillment:** The officer captures the missing panel while still on-site. The new image is attached locally to the scan.
3. **Unified Batch Sync:** When connectivity returns, the sync manager flushes:
   - Initial inspection visit
   - Initial scan and front panel image
   - Fulfill capture task action with back panel image
   - Reassessment request
4. **Server Reassessment Execution:** The backend runs the full 26-rule legal compliance engine against all aggregated panels, updating the overall result to `COMPLIANT` or `VIOLATION` in a single coherent server transaction.
