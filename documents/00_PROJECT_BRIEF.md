## 1. Executive Summary

NiyamNetra is a cloud-assisted, offline-resilient inspection decision-support platform designed for Legal Metrology field officers and central enforcement administrators. It automates the verification of pre-packaged commodities and e-commerce listings against the **Legal Metrology (Packaged Commodities) Rules, 2011** (as amended up to the Fourth Amendment Rules, 2026 under G.S.R. 826(E) dated 21.09.2026 and the Jan Vishwas Act).

By replacing slow manual calipers, paper checklists, and subjective visual estimates with high-precision optical capture, cloud OCR, structured schema normalization, and a strictly deterministic statutory rule engine, NiyamNetra reduces inspection turnaround time from 15+ minutes per package to **under 2 seconds**.

## 2. Problem Statement & Real-World Need

Pre-packaged goods across India are governed by Chapter II of the Legal Metrology (Packaged Commodities) Rules, 2011. Every retail package must display mandatory declarations:
- Manufacturer, packer, or importer identity and complete address
- Generic or common commodity name
- Net quantity (standard metric units conforming to Rules 12 & 13)
- Maximum Retail Price (MRP) inclusive of all taxes and unit sale price (USP)
- Month and year of manufacture, packing, or import
- Consumer care details (name, address, telephone, email)
- Principal Display Panel (PDP) numeral height adhering strictly to Rule 7 Table-I

### Key Challenges in the Field:
1. **Measurement Difficulty:** Field officers cannot accurately measure 1.0 mm to 6.0 mm font heights on curved, flexible, or glossy packages with physical calipers.
2. **Incomplete Coverage:** Many packaging violations occur on side, back, or crimp panels that single-photo systems fail to capture.
3. **Evidence Authenticity:** In prosecutions under Section 36 of the Legal Metrology Act, 2009, traders frequently contest evidence origin and measurement validity.
4. **Offline Conditions:** Enforcement inspections often take place in basement godowns, wholesale mandis, and rural kirana stores with zero cellular connectivity.

## 3. Core Capabilities & Architecture

| Capability | Technical Realization | Architectural Benefit |
|---|---|---|
| **Integrity-Preserving Capture** | Dual-image pipeline: Authoritative camera original preserved untouched with SHA-256 hash; lightweight derived analysis JPEG used for inference | Eliminates evidence tampering claims; satisfies forensic authenticity standards |
| **Edge Quality Gate** | Client-side OpenCV/Canvas heuristic analysis (Laplacian blur, specular glare, luma histogram, edge clipping) | Prevents unreadable images from wasting cloud bandwidth or producing false findings |
| **Separation of Concerns** | **OCR Reads → LLM Structures → Rules Decide → Aggregation Assesses** | Zero LLM legal hallucination; statutory logic is 100% deterministic, auditable, and versioned |
| **Deterministic Rule Engine** | 26 active statutory rules evaluated mathematically against declared packaging geometry and physical calibration | Transparent legal citations, exact statutory limb attribution (Section 36(1) vs 36(2)) |
| **Dual-Verdict Governance** | Automated `engine_verdict` is permanently immutable; `human_verdict` records officer adjudication with mandatory reasons | Preserves algorithmic objectivity while maintaining officer authority |
| **Smart Recapture Loop** | Automated generation of targeted panel tasks (e.g., "Recapture Back Panel for Consumer Care") | Guides inspectors to resolve missing evidence without restarting visits |
| **Offline Synchronization** | Local SQLite/IndexedDB queue with idempotency keys, single-use capture tokens, and clock skew correction | Full functionality without network; seamless auto-sync upon reconnection |

## 6. System Boundaries & Non-Goals

To maintain rigorous statutory integrity, NiyamNetra enforces strict boundaries:
- **Decision-Support, Not Automated Prosecution:** NiyamNetra never issues automatic legal notices, compounds offenses, or levies fines. The platform generates evidence-backed draft violation dossiers; the authorized human officer retains sole statutory authority under the Act.
- **Packaging Declarations Only:** The system verifies labeling declarations under the LM Rules, 2011. It does **not** conduct chemical laboratory testing, adulteration checks, or food safety analysis (governed separately by FSSAI).
- **Physical Scale Requirement:** Font height verification under Rule 7 Table-I requires a physical calibration reference (standard ID-1 card, standard coin, or officer-verified panel measurement). Uncalibrated images yield `not_assessed` with a calibration capture request, preventing false violations.
- **Fail-Safe Legal Interpretation:** In ambiguous statutory provisions (such as the Fourth Amendment Rule 6(4A)(d) origin-marking clause), missing evidence produces `REVIEW_REQUIRED` / `not_assessed` rather than false algorithmic failure.
